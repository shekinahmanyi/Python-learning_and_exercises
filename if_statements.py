# Example code for if statements in Python
# cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
# for car in cars:
#     if car == 'audi': # check if the first value in the list is 'audi' and if it is, print it in uppercase
#         print(car.upper())
#     else:
#         print(car.title())

#Checking for Inequality
# requested_topping = 'mushrooms'

# if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
#     print("Hold the anchovies!")

#Checking whether a value is in a list
# banned_users = ['martha', 'john', 'joe']
# user = 'martha'
# if user not in banned_users:
#     print(f"{user.title()}, you can post a response if you wish.")
# else:
#     print(f"{user.title()}, you are banned from posting responses.")

#Boolean Expressions
# game_active = True
