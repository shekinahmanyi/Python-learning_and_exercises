#Exercise 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

alien_color = ['green', 'yellow', 'red']

if 'green' in alien_color:
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
if 'yellow' in alien_color:
    print("You just earned 10 points!")
if 'blue' in alien_color:
    print("You just earned 15 points!")

print("\nFinished playing the game!")
