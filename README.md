### THIS REPOSITORY  CONTAINS EVERYTHING THAT I LEARNT IN THIS BOOK :

- Eric Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming

#### THIS IS DIVIDED INTO 2 PARTS :

- PART 1 - BASICS

- PART 2 - PROJECTS

#### PROJECTS :

##### PROJECT 1 - ALIEN INVASION

##### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
- The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the space bar. 
- When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. 
- The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. 
- If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

##### PROJECT 2 - DATA VISUALIZATION

##### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- Using Matplotlib to make simple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots. 
- creating a data set based on the concept of a random walk—a visualization generated from a series of random decisions.
- Using a package called Plotly, which creates visualizations that work well on digital devices
- Using Plotly to analyze the results of rolling dice. 

##### PROJECT 3 - WRITING A SPEC (WEB APPLICATION)

##### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- We’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. 
- The Learning Log home page will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. 
- Once logged in:
- a user can create new topics, 
- add new entries, 
- read and edit existing entries.
